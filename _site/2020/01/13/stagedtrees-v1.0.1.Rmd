[stagedtrees v1.0.1 is available on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=stagedtrees) 

This new version implements some bug fixes and two new functions: `get_stage`
and `get_path`. 

The new functions can be used to obtain the stage associated to a given path 
or viceversa, the paths relative to a given stage. 

```{r}
model <- PhDArticles[,1:3] %>% full %>% bhc.sevt

get_stage(model, c(Articles = "1-2",Gender = "male"))

get_path(model, "Kids", 5)
```
