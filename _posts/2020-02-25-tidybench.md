Causal structure learning from time series: Large regression coefficients may predict causal links better in practice than small p-values [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09573). 

Check our code [tidybench](https://github.com/sweichwald/tidybench/) and 
the performance of our algorithms on the [CauseMe](https://causeme.uv.es/rank/) 
benchmarking platform.
